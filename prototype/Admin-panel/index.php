			<div class="content">
				<p> The Australian Backyard Bird Box is an educational, citizen science application. There are three core modules to AB<sup>3</sup> - the administration module, the recording module, and the learning module. </p>
				<h3> Administration Module </h3>
				<p> The administration module allows verified users to create, edit, and delete entries in the AB<sup>3</sup> database through a web interface. The administration module also enables more complex functionality, such as ranking and tagging entries, and creating databases for new locations and animals. </p>
				<h3> Recording Module </h3>
				<p> The recording module is the core citizen science element of AB<sup>3</sup>. In this module, users may record birds from their local environment, and then listen to- and manipulate- those recordings. <i>Some stuff about cool algorithms when we do it</i></p>
				<h3> Learning Module </h3>
				<p> The learning module is an educational bird matching game, targeted at users of all ages. In the bird match game, users will hone their bird-spotting skills, and learn to match spectrograms with waveforms. <i>More stuff from Sean's report? </i> </p>
